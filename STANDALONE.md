# StepGrid16 — Standalone Guarantee

StepGrid16 is a fully standalone application.

- No API keys are required
- No network access is required
- No AI services are used at runtime
- No runtime importmaps to external CDNs. All code ships inside the build.
- All core functionality works offline:
  - Sequencing
  - Chaining
  - Save/Load
  - MIDI Output
  - MIDI Export

AI tools may be used during development, but are never required to run or build the app.
