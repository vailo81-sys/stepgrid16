# StepGrid16 Manifesto

StepGrid16 is not a creative assistant. It is a deterministic execution grid. 
It follows these non-negotiable laws:

## I. Machines Don't Suggest
The machine exists to execute decisions, not to make them. 
- ❌ No generative "AI" buttons.
- ❌ No "smart" pattern variations.
- ❌ No "fill" algorithms.
- ❌ No probabilistic "maybe" triggers.
If a note is there, it is because a human placed it there.

## II. State Must Be Explicit
Hidden state is a failure of design. 
- Every parameter for every step must be visible or accessible via a direct, high-contrast readout.
- No "shift-layers" that hide critical playback information.
- No "context-aware" reinterpretation of data.
0x3C is 60. It is always 60.

## III. Precision Over Vibe
"Feel" is often an excuse for poor clocking. 
- Microtiming is defined in milliseconds, not abstract "swing" percentages.
- MIDI export is a bit-accurate render of the live engine, not an approximation.
- The grid geometry is authoritative; it does not stretch or distort to "fit" the screen.

## IV. The "Instrument" Constraint
Hardware survives because it is predictable. 
- The UI uses high-contrast Universal Tokens to survive low-quality monitors.
- No shadows, no glows, no "aesthetic" blurs.
- Visual hierarchy is determined by execution authority, not decoration.

## V. Absolute Independence
StepGrid16 is a sovereign entity.
- Zero network dependencies at runtime.
- Zero telemetry.
- Zero "cloud" features.
The machine works in a bunker, or it doesn't work at all.

## VI. Zero Correction
The machine does not know what "good" sounds like.
- Scales are filters for input, never "fixers" for output.
- No auto-quantization of microtiming.
- The user is allowed to be wrong. The machine is only required to be accurate.
